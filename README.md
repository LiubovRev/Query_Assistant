Real-Time Text and Image Query Assistant

Create a Python application utilizing Google Gemini Live API where:
- Users provide an image (from a file or camera capture).
- Users type questions about the image, with the text input simulated in real-time.
- The API analyzes the image and responds to the question, with responses displayed in real-time.

Bonus: speak in the browser instead of typing"
